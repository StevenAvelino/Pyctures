The goal of the project was to create a picture management application, similar to Picasa.
The main task was to handle pictures properties, or metadatas.

## Documentation

The documentation has been written in markdown and is available in the repository, however, for a better look and easier navigation, it is preferable to read it with GitBook by clicking on this [link](https://stevenavelino.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/)

## Organisation

For the organisation of the project, we decided to split the application in half
* GUI
* Other functions

KÃ©vin did all the functions related to the GUI.
Steven did all the other functions.
