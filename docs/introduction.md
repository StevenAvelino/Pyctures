# Developer Documentation

This documentation is for developers to understand how the Pyctures application work and how it was designed.

## Introduction

The project was made in the context of a school project.
The "client" asked for a replacement of Picasa that was gonna get replaced by Google Images and was going to use the cloud, which the client didn't want to.

All the requirements for the project can be found here.

## Different choices

First : the language used : Python
We chose Python for 2 reasons :

### Simplicity
Python is an easy language, easy to setup and with a big community around it if help is required and with many modules.
The main issue was the creation of the GUI, Python being a scripting language, it wasn't optimised to make fast or good looking GUIs. But since the project seemed pretty small, we still decided to go for Python.

### Learning
Steven had some experience with Python, but KÃ©vin didn't have any. The project being small, we thought it was a good idea to learn while doing, since Python is pretty popular nowadays, learning it is a plus.
