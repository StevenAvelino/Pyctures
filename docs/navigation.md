# Navigation

Once in the application, you can view 9 images at a time.
By clicking on the Previous / Next buttons you can navigate in the folder.
To change the folder simply click on the name of the folder in the left menu, this will load the first nine images of the folder in question.

## Bug

Currently, there is a bug with browsing during a search. After searching, the first nine images are displayed, but the "Suivant" button does not work.
