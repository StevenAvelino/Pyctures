# Properties

To add / edit the properties of a photo, just click once on it. In the lower part of the application you can see the different properties. Some are editable, so you can edit the text and to save, simply change fields. The metadata are stored on the image, so you can transfer your images and still have the properties on them.

 ## Favorite
 
To mark a picture as a favorite, simply click on the star under the "Favori" property.
Click it again to go back and remove the favorite status
