# Start

Each time the application starts, it will control the naming of your photos.
If they do not correspond to our norm, they will be renamed as follows: "NameFolder_YYYYMMDDhhmmss1" For example "Venice_201711291607031". The last digit is by default 1 but if two images were taken exactly at the same time, the second image will have the number 2.
You must also delete the image sample folder from Windows.

## Issue

Currently, if you copy pictures that were already opened in the application in an other folder (Venice to Rome, for example), the application will crash.
